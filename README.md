## Overview
This analysis explores how Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear/Greed) influences
trader behavior and performance on Hyperliquid.

## Methodology
- Aligned daily Fear/Greed sentiment with trade-level data
- Aggregated metrics per trader per day (PnL, win rate, trade frequency, size)
- Compared performance and behavior across sentiment regimes
- Segmented traders by frequency and consistency
- (Optional) Clustered traders into behavioral archetypes

## Key Insights
1. Trader PnL volatility increases significantly during Fear periods,
   indicating emotionally driven decision-making.
2. Trade frequency increases during Greed, but win rates do not improve
   proportionally, suggesting overtrading.
3. More selective traders perform more consistently across sentiment regimes.

## Strategy Recommendations
1. During Fear days, reduce position size and frequency to control downside risk.
2. During Greed days, enforce stricter entry criteria for frequent traders.

## Next Steps
These findings can be used to design sentiment-aware trading rules and
monitor trader behavior dynamically.
